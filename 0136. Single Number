LeetCode No. 136 Single Number

This problem can be solved by hash table. However, the bit manipulation method presented below is more efficient in space complexity. 

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size()==1){return nums[0];}
        int res = 0;
        for(int num : nums)
        {
            res = res^num;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
