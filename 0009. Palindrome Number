LeetCode No. 9 Palindrome Number

This problem can be solved directly. However, a simple observation is that we only need compare the first half and latter half of the integer, 
which makes the algorithm more efficient.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        vector<int> digits;
        if(x == 0){return true;}
        if(x < 0 || x %10 == 0){return false;}
        int cur = 0;
        while(x > cur){
            cur = cur*10 + x%10;
            x = x / 10;
        }// extract and reverse the latter half of the integer
        return x == cur || x == cur / 10;        
    }
};
