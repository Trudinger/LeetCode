LeetCode No. 11 Container With Most Water

This is a classical problem for two pointers. We simply initiate two pointers at both ends and shrink the interval by moving the pointer pointing to the lower height.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int Max = 0;
        int i = 0, j = height.size()-1;
        if(height.size()==1){return min(height[i],height[j]);}
        while(i < j)
        {
            if(min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i)>Max){Max = min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i);}
            if(height[i] >= height[j]){j--;}
            else{i++;}
        }
        return Max;
    }
};
