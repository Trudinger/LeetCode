LeetCode No. 560 Subarray Sum Equals K

This problem is a nice application of hash table for searching. The interesting thing is that brute force solution will give TLE error and only the following one-pass method 
can pass all test cases. Another point is to notice that subscripting a hash map will create an item if the key is not found. This behaviour is in contrast to that of a vector.

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int,int> T;
        int count = 0, sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            sum = sum + nums[i];
            if(sum == k){count++;}
            if(T.find(sum-k)!=T.end()){
                count = count + T[sum-k];
            }
            T[sum]++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
