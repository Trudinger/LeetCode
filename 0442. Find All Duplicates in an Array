LeetCode No. 442 Find All Duplicates in an Array

This problem can be solved by sorting or hash table. However, to avoid using extra space and keep runtime O(n), we need to use something different.
The condition says 1 <= a[i] <= n (n = size of array) which means a[i]-1 is a valid index for the array and we can use this fact to mark the visited numbers.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans;

        for (auto num : nums) {
            if (nums[abs(num) - 1] < 0) {  // seen before
                ans.push_back(abs(num));
            }
            nums[abs(num) - 1] *= -1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
