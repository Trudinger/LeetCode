LeetCode No.829 Consecutive Numbers Sum

This is a simple application of Gauss formula for arithmetic series.

Consider the equation (a + a + (k-1))*k = 2N which is equivalent to (2a + (k-1))*k = 2N. Note that a > 0 and thereby 2a + k - 1 > k.
We only need to check all divisors of 2N which are smaller than sqrt{2N} and solve the integer a.

class Solution {
public:
    int consecutiveNumbersSum(int N) {
        int sol = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i*i <= 2*N; ++i)
        {
            if((2*N)%i==0){
                if((2*N/i - i + 1)%2 == 0){sol++;}
            }
        }
        return sol;
    }
};
