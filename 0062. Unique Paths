LeetCode No. 62 Unique Paths

This problem is  typical dynamic programming problem. The recursion relation is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]. Be careful about the boundary condition.
Note that the renewal only relies on the previous array. Therefore, we can reduce the space from a matrix to a vector. Another method is to realize that the recursion relation
implies that d[i][j] has a simple combinatorial formula.

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n,1);
        for(int i = 1; i < m; ++i){
            for(int j = 1; j <= n-1; ++j){
                dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};
